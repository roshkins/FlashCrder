#Welcome to my quizzer!

This was a flash card program I wrote during my sophmore year of high school in may of 2010 to help me prepare for a geometry test, as you can see by the files. I don't really remember the specific test, but I hope it helped me!
I think this program shows very well that I could do object oriented programming.

## File Format
The program will create a notepad document for you if you haven't created a quiz file already. The format is the question, newline, the correct answer, newline then three incorrect answers each on their own lines, followed by a new line with the number zero.

 An example:
  
      What is 4 * 4?
 
	  16

	  5

	  12

	  8

	  0

## Interval

Upon running the program you will be greeted by a randomly selected question. The questions are always randomly selected. You can determine the time interval 
between questions to give you time to absorb what steps you did incorrectly and to not overload you with questions. You can choose to auto-advance to keep it on a timer or you can
set the pacing yourself by clicking next question. I hope this feature helps someone someday.

## Keeping Track of the questions for you

This program automatically keeps track of the questions that you have answered and will weight the question in such a way that if you answer a question correctly 
it will show up less often and vice versa.
